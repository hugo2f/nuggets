### Author: Joseph Hirsh

## Assumptions:

- The server and the client share a mutually-understood communication protocol.

## Usage of ChatGPT:

I occasionally used ChatGPT for these purposes:

1. Looking up C library function usage.
2. Suggesting style improvements for already functional code.
3. Explaining good practices around global variable usage.
4. Assisting in writing the proper ncurses code, as I was not familiar with ncurses before this project.

## Peer Support:

- I did not seek any peer support outside of my group during the development process.
