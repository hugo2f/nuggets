## Client Assumptions and Development Notes 

### Author: Joseph Hirsh

### Date: March 2nd, 2024

## Assumptions:

1. The server and the client share a mutually-understood communication protocol.
2. The client.c file can be compiled in two modes, one for the main release, the other for testing (see `IMPLEMENTATION.md` under "Testing Plan")
3. There are memory issues with curses we do not bother adressing

## Usage of ChatGPT:

I occasionally used ChatGPT for these purposes:

1. Looking up C library function usage.
2. Suggesting style improvements for already functional code.
3. Explaining good practices around global variables.
4. Assisting in using the proper ncurses functions (as I was not familiar with ncurses before this project).
5. Assisting in writing the setPlayerName function in client
6. Writing some of the pseudocode for the implementation specs (but NOT the comments or DESIGN specs)

## Peer Support:

- I did not seek any peer support outside of my group during the development process.
